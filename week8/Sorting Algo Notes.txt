Sorting Algorithms:

selection sort
bubble sort
insertion sort

Comb sort: Divide into multiple groups then bubble sort it

Shell sort: Divide into a few groups, decreasing number of groups. Can use any sort between the 2.

Heap sort: transfer data into a heap, then push the root into the output array. Then update the root

Quicksort: Set up bounds and then recurse. Quite complicated

Mergesort: + If array size >= 2, split array into subarrays

         + Recurse

+ Merge back 2getha


Radix Sort: Sort all nums into piles 0-9, according to right-most digit (of its value)

Then combine back to a list.

Then do it for SECOND RIGHT MOST digit. If not enough digits, pad with 0
