1) Draw a tree for which the preorder and inorder traversals generate the same sequence
2) Design an algorithm (pseudocode or prose) to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree
3) Design an algorithm (pseudocode or prose) to check if a binary tree is perfectly balanced
(smallest height possible for the number of nodes)
